### **Introduction**

Welcome to **Pycolee**.

**Pycolee** aims to create a community where you can freely share exercises and lessons using the Python programming language (https://www.python.org/). As can be seen in the graph below, Python has become increasingly popular among developers in recent years.

### Why Python?

Whether you are a **Niubbo** or a **Veteran** of this programming language, I want to explain to you why today it is better to choose Python.

#### 1. Its popularity
Python was born in 1991 (thanks to Guido van Rossum) as a successor to the language [ABC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)). In the video below it is possible to see its impressive growth over the last 3 years.

#### 2. The Big companies use Python
Some of the biggest companies, including: Uber, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Dropbox and Reddit use this language for the development of their applications. Python is also used in robotics, in [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) and in data analytics systems

#### 3. Machine learning
What can we do with Python? very much! Its libraries are made to work with other popular programming languages ​​and this makes it excellent also for machine learning. [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) works primarily with Python, reason is that neural networks and machine learning are constantly evolving and expanding, which makes Python a programming language that can last for many years..

#### 4. Support
Python vanta un ottimo supporto a livello di community, basti pensare che su [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) vi sono più di 1 milione di domande con altrettante risposte.

#### 5. Easy to learn
The simplicity in reading and writing the code allow to teach it all over the world and, above all, in the american schools.
The user experience today is fundamental!

#### 6. Open Source

Python is Open Source and GPL.

#### Ready...go!!
After having listed these 6 main points, I ask you: why not start and support this project?
